# 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Easy`

## 英文題目本身
You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N.  In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden x to garden y.

Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

Note:
```
1 <= N <= 10000
0 <= paths.size <= 20000
No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
It is guaranteed an answer exists.
```
## 題目要求
給你 `N` 個 node, 跟每個 node 的連線 `path[]`
總共有四個顏色可以塗, 根據相鄰兩點不能塗上同樣顏色的要求, 回船上色完的答案
## 想法
想不出來, lee大神想的解法
首先, 用一個 `Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();`來記錄所有連線

`int[] res = new int[N]` 這是回傳答案放的位置


#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
    public int[] gardenNoAdj(int N, int[][] paths) {
        //Create a graph
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        //... via adjacency list
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) graph.put(i, new HashSet<>());
        //Add the edges 
        
        for (int[] path : paths){
            int x = path[0] - 1; //Due to 1-based indexing 
            int y = path[1] - 1; //Due to 1-based indexing
            //Undirected edge
            graph.get(x).add(y);
            graph.get(y).add(x);
        }
        //Here is our solution vector where res[i] represents color of garden i+1
        int[] res = new int[N];
        
        //Now run graph painting algorithm
        
        //For each garden
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            //Use 5 instead of 4 so we can easily use 1-based indexing of the garden colors
            // 初始都是0, 
            int[] colors = new int[5]; 
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(i)){
                // Mark the color as used if neighbor has used it before.
                // 每個 color 的 index 就是顏色的意思, 代表這個 node 的有用過的顏色
                colors[res[neighbor]] = 1; 
            }
            // Now just use a color that has not been used yet
            // 現在我們從color上面找一輪, 如果發現沒用過的, 就把顏色上上去
            for (int c = 4; c >= 1; c--){
                if (colors[c] != 1) //colors[c] == 0 => the color has not been used yet,
                    res[i] = c; //so let's use that one
            }
        }
        
        return res;
        
    }
}
```
