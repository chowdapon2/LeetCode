# 1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Medium` `Heap` `Greedy`

## 英文題目本身
You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array sticks, where `sticks[i]` is the length of the ith stick.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths x and y into one stick by paying a cost of `x + y`. You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
Output: 14
Explanation: You start with sticks = [2,4,3].
1. Combine sticks 2 and 3 for a cost of 2 + 3 = 5. Now you have sticks = [5,4].
2. Combine sticks 5 and 4 for a cost of 5 + 4 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9].
There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
Output: 30
Explanation: You start with sticks = [1,8,3,5].
1. Combine sticks 1 and 3 for a cost of 1 + 3 = 4. Now you have sticks = [4,8,5].
2. Combine sticks 4 and 5 for a cost of 4 + 5 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9,8].
3. Combine sticks 9 and 8 for a cost of 9 + 8 = 17. Now you have sticks = [17].
There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 4 + 9 + 17 = 30.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: sticks = [5]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is only one stick, so you don't need to do anything. The total cost is 0.

```

Constraints:

- `1 <= sticks.length <= 10^`
- `1 <= sticks[i] <= 10^4`
## 題目要求
給你一串樹枝長度, 兩兩相接到最後面全部接起來成為一根
每次兩兩相接的時候把每次相接的長度加起來, 求這個加總最小會是多少?
## 想法
有n個樹枝, 那就一定會加總n-1次, 要最小, 那就每次都加總最小的兩個阿
#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
    public int connectSticks(int[] sticks) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for(int stick: sticks){
            heap.add(stick);
        }
        int total = 0;
        while(!heap.isEmpty()){
            int temp = heap.poll();
            if(heap.isEmpty()) break;
            int temp2 = heap.poll();
            total = total+temp+temp2;
            heap.add(temp+temp2);
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

別人比較漂亮的相同概念解法, 快多了
#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
   public int connectSticks(int[] sticks) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int s : sticks) {
            pq.offer(s);
        }
        int sum = 0;
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int two = pq.poll() + pq.poll();
            sum += two;
            pq.offer(two);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
