# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Easy` `Array`

## 英文題目本身
We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```
Note:
```
1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
bits[i] is always 0 or 1.
```
## 題目要求
給你一串01數字, 最終一定是0結尾, ,整串數字會由 **0, 11, 10** 組成, 判斷最後一位數0 是不是one-bit character

## 想法
別人想法
用一個pointer i下去跑
遇到0 往下跳一格
遇到1, 一定是兩bit, 跳兩格

直到`(i < bits.length-1)`跑完看 i 是否再最尾端上
如果是, 就是 ture勒
```javascript
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int i=0;
        while (i < bits.length-1) {
            if (bits[i] == 0) i++;
            else i+= 2;
        }
        return i == bits.length-1;
    }
}
```

### 想法 2
只要判斷最尾端的數字就好
We don't need to traverse the whole array, just check the last part of it.

1. if there is only one symbol in array the answer is always true (as last element is 0)
2. if there are two 0s at the end again the answer is true no matter what the rest symbols are( ...1100, ...1000,)
3. if there is 1 right before the last element(...10), the outcome depends on the count of sequential 1, i.e.
  a. if there is odd amount of 1(10, ...01110, etc) the answer is false as there is a single 1 without pair
  b. if it's even (110, ...011110, etc) the answer is true, as 0 at the end doesn't have anything to pair with
```javascript
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int ones = 0;
        //Starting from one but last, as last one is always 0.
        for (int i = bits.length - 2; i >= 0 && bits[i] != 0 ; i--) { 
            ones++;
        }
        if (ones % 2 > 0) return false; 
        return true;
    }
}
```

這也是一樣的看法, 從倒數第二個值開始看
如果是0, `(bits.length - i) % 2` 一定是 0
如果不是, 開始算有多少個1, 算下來如果是偶數, 回傳 true
```javascript=
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int i = bits.length - 2;
        while (i >= 0 && bits[i] > 0) i--;
        return (bits.length - i) % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```
