# 973. K Closest Points to Origin
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Medium` `Heap`

## 英文題目本身
We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)


Example 1:
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
 ```

Note:
```
1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000
-10000 < points[i][0] < 10000
-10000 < points[i][1] < 10000
```
## 題目要求
給你一堆點跟一個數字K, 求前K個離原點最近的點
## 想法
用 PriorityQueue
#### 結果
挺慢的
Runtime: 43 ms, faster than 22.34% 
Memory Usage: 114.7 MB, less than 14.36% 
```javascript
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((A,B) ->{
            return (A[0]*A[0]+A[1]*A[1])-(B[0]*B[0]+B[1]*B[1]);
        });
        for(int[] node : points){
            pq.add(node);
        }
        
        int[][] ans = new int[K][2];
        for(int i=0; i< K ;i++){
            int[] temp = pq.poll();
            ans[i][0] = temp[0];
            ans[i][1] = temp[1];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
類似做法, 一樣慢
```javascript
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        Arrays.sort(points, Comparator.comparing(p -> p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1]));
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(points, 0, K);
    }
```
