# 1860. Incremental Memory Leak
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Medium`

## 英文題目本身
You are given two integers memory1 and memory2 representing the available memory in bits on two memory sticks. There is currently a faulty program running that consumes an increasing amount of memory every second.

At the ith second (starting from 1), i bits of memory are allocated to the stick with more available memory (or from the first memory stick if both have the same available memory). If neither stick has at least i bits of available memory, the program crashes.

Return an array containing [crashTime, memory1crash, memory2crash], where crashTime is the time (in seconds) when the program crashed and memory1crash and memory2crash are the available bits of memory in the first and second sticks respectively.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: memory1 = 2, memory2 = 2
Output: [3,1,0]
Explanation: The memory is allocated as follows:
- At the 1st second, 1 bit of memory is allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 1 bit of available memory.
- At the 2nd second, 2 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 0 bits of available memory.
- At the 3rd second, the program crashes. The sticks have 1 and 0 bits available respectively.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: memory1 = 8, memory2 = 11
Output: [6,0,4]
Explanation: The memory is allocated as follows:
- At the 1st second, 1 bit of memory is allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 10 bit of available memory.
- At the 2nd second, 2 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 8 bits of available memory.
- At the 3rd second, 3 bits of memory are allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 5 bits of available memory.
- At the 4th second, 4 bits of memory are allocated to stick 2. The second stick now has 4 bits of available memory.
- At the 5th second, 5 bits of memory are allocated to stick 1. The first stick now has 0 bits of available memory.
- At the 6th second, the program crashes. The sticks have 0 and 4 bits available respectively.
```

Constraints:

- `0 <= memory1, memory2 <= 231 - 1`
## 題目要求
給兩條memory容量memory1,memory2, 系統需求 memory 從 1 開始一路向上
每次從多的 memory 條先分配, 最終回傳三個數值{最後跑到哪個memory需求停下來, memory1剩下多少, memory2剩下多少}

## 想法
直接來, 但是我的while停止條件跟智障一樣有危險, 還有return ans的方式太蠢
#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int m1, int m2) {
        boolean flag = true;
        int step= 1;
        int[] ans = new int[3];
        while(flag){
            if(m1 == m2 && m1 !=0){
                if(step > m1){
                    ans[0] = step;
                    ans[1] = m1;
                    ans[2] = m2;
                    return ans;
                }else{
                    m1-=step;
                    step++;
                }
            }else if(m1>m2){
                if(step > m1){
                    ans[0] = step;
                    ans[1] = m1;
                    ans[2] = m2;
                    return ans;
                }else{
                    m1-=step;
                    step++;
                    
                }
            }else{
                if(step > m2){
                    ans[0] = step;
                    ans[1] = m1;
                    ans[2] = m2;
                    return ans;
                }else{
                    m2-=step;
                    step++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

同上  美型好用板
#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int i = 1;
        while(Math.max(memory1, memory2) >= i){
            if(memory1 >= memory2)
                memory1 -= i;
            else
                memory2 -= i;
            i++;
        }
        return new int[]{i, memory1, memory2};
    }
}
