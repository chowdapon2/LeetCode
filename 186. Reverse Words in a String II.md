# 186. Reverse Words in a String II
###### tags: `LeetCode` `medium`

## 英文題目本身
Given a character `array s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by a single space.

Your code must solve the problem in-place, i.e. **without** allocating extra space.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = ["a"]
Output: ["a"]
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.
- s does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in s are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.
## 題目要求
要求你在沒有用到多餘空間的方式下  reverse array裡面的字串
前後 reverse, 但是每個 word順序要保留
## 想法
討論區解
直接把整串顛倒過來後
開始用for loop跑
跑到 空格處,  把reverse的 **再 reverse**一遍  word就變正啦~!

#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
   public void reverseWords(char[] s) {
        // Three step to reverse
        // 1, reverse the whole sentence
        reverse(s, 0, s.length - 1);
        // 2, reverse each word
        int start = 0;      
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
            if (s[i] == ' ') {
                reverse(s, start, i - 1);
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }
        // 3, reverse the last word, if there is only one word this will solve the corner case
        reverse(s, start, s.length - 1);
    }

    public void reverse(char[] s, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            char temp = s[start];
            s[start] = s[end];
            s[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
