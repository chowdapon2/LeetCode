# 198. House Robber
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Easy` `Dynamic Programming`

## 英文題目本身
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) 
and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```
## 題目要求
不能將相鄰兩個array中的質都取出來, 只能隔開

## 想法
DP解阿~!  跟爬樓梯大同小異的概念
新的一格的答案會是 `result[i] = max(A[i]+result[i-2] or result[i-1])`
```javascript
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] A) {
        int[] result = new int[A.length];
        // result[i] = max(A[i]+result[i-2] or result[i-1])
        if (A.length ==0) return 0;
        if (A.length ==1) return A[0];
        if (A.length ==2) return Math.max(A[0],A[1]);
        result[0] = A[0];
        result[1] = Math.max(A[0],A[1]);
        for(int i=2; i<A.length; i++){
            result[i] = Math.max(A[i]+result[i-2] , result[i-1]);
        }
        return result[A.length-1];
    }
}
```
