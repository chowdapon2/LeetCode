# 1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters
###### tags: `LeetCode` `medium`

## 英文題目本身
You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array dist of size `n`, where` dist[i]` is the **initial distance** in meters of the ith monster from the city.

The monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array speed of size `n`, where `speed[i]` is the speed of the ith monster in meters per minute.

The monsters start moving at **minute 0**. You have a weapon that you can choose to use at the start of every minute, including minute 0. You cannot use the weapon in the middle of a minute. The weapon can eliminate any monster that is still alive. You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city exactly at the start of a minute, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon in that minute.

Return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At the start of minute 0, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4], you eliminate the first monster.
At the start of minute 1, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3], you don't do anything.
At the start of minute 2, the distances of the monsters are [X,1,2], you eliminate the second monster.
At the start of minute 3, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,1], you eliminate the third monster.
All 3 monsters can be eliminated.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: dist = [1,1,2,3], speed = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
At the start of minute 0, the distances of the monsters are [1,1,2,3], you eliminate the first monster.
At the start of minute 1, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,1,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: dist = [3,2,4], speed = [5,3,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:
At the start of minute 0, the distances of the monsters are [3,2,4], you eliminate the first monster.
At the start of minute 1, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.
 ```
Constraints:

- `n == dist.length == speed.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 10^5`
## 題目要求
給你怪物到達位置0 的距離, 速度, 你有一把武器可以一次消滅一隻怪物, 一分鐘能使用一次
回傳再有怪獸到達位置0之前, 總共可以消滅幾隻怪獸
## 想法
沒想出來, 看提示是說
1. 找出每個怪獸抵達終點要花多少時間
2. 找出每個怪獸到達順序

所以  根據上面, 先算出一個 table `time[]` 來記錄每個怪獸到達時間
接著  對到達時間做sorting後
從0開始往後一個一個數, 如果每往後一個他的到達時間都比目前時間晚, 表示可以被消滅
#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
    public int eliminateMaximum(int[] dist, int[] speed) {
        int n = dist.length;
        // Find the amount of time it takes each monster to arrive.
        int[] time = new int[n];
        for(int i =0; i<n; i++){
            time[i] = dist[i]%speed[i] == 0 ? dist[i]/speed[i] : dist[i]/speed[i]+1;
        }
        int cur =0;
        Arrays.sort(time);
        while(cur < n){
            int arrived = time[cur];
            if(cur <arrived){
                cur++;
            }else{
                break;
            }
            
        }
        return cur;
    }
}
```
