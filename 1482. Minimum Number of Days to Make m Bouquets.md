# 1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Binary Search` `Medium`

## 英文題目本身
Given an integer array bloomDay, an integer m and an integer k.

We need to make m bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use k adjacent flowers from the garden.

The garden consists of n flowers, the ith flower will bloom in the bloomDay[i] and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.

Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make m bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return -1.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Let's see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower didn't bloom in the garden.
We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.
After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.
Here's the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: bloomDay = [1000000000,1000000000], m = 1, k = 1
Output: 1000000000
Explanation: You need to wait 1000000000 days to have a flower ready for a bouquet.
```
Example 5:
```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,2,9,3,8,4,7,5,6], m = 4, k = 2
Output: 9
 ```

Constraints:
```
bloomDay.length == n
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9
1 <= m <= 10^6
1 <= k <= n
```
## 題目要求

## 想法
一開始想錯方向用 Priority Queue去解
這類題型
1. 在一定範圍中, 找到一個正確的值回傳
2. 每找一個值, 就要判對這個值符不符合條件
看到上面這兩項, 可以先想想可不可以用 Binary Search去解
#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
    public int minDays(int[] bloomDay, int m, int k) {
        if (bloomDay.length < m * k) return -1;
        int min = 0, max = 0;
        for (int i : bloomDay) {
            max = Math.max(max, i);
            min = Math.min(min, i);
        }
        // Take the boundary starting from 1 to the max day in the bloomDay.
        while (min < max) {
            int mid = min + (max - min) / 2;
            int possibleBouquets = getPossibleBouquets(bloomDay, mid, k);
            // The
            if (possibleBouquets < m) {
                min = mid + 1;
            } else {
                max = mid;
            }
        }
        return min;
    }
    private int getPossibleBouquets(int[] bloomDay, int day, int k) {
        // This method is to find the number of Bouquets that can be formed on a given day.
        int bouquets = 0, flowersCollected = 0;
        for (int value : bloomDay) {
            if (value <= day) {
                // If the current flower can be taken with in days then increase the flower flowersCollected.
                flowersCollected++;
            } else {
                // If there is a flower in between that takes more number of days then the given day, then resent the counter.
                flowersCollected = 0;
            }
            // If the flowersCollected is same as the required flower per bookie, then increase the bookies count;
            if (flowersCollected == k) {
                bouquets++;
                flowersCollected = 0;
            }
        }
        return bouquets;
    }
}
```
