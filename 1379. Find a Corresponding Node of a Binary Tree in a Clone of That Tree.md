# 1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree

###### tags: `LeetCode` `Medium` `Tree` 

## 英文題目本身
Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.

The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.

Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.

Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.

Follow up: Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. The target node is a green node from the original tree. The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: tree = [7], target =  7
Output: 7
```
Example 3:

```
Input: tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4
Output: 4
```
Example 4:

```
Input: tree = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 5
Output: 5
```
Example 5:

```
Input: tree = [1,2,null,3], target = 2
Output: 2
 ```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
- The values of the nodes of the tree are unique.
- target node is a node from the original tree and is not null.
## 題目要求
給你兩個一模一樣的 tree, 在另一顆 tree 上找到相同的點
## 想法
用遞迴找出從root到 target的路
但是我的遞迴沒有想出來, 下面這是別人想出來的

        }
        
        if (current.right != null && generatePathToTarget(current.right, target, path)){
            path.push('r');
            return true;
        }
        
        if (current.left != null && generatePathToTarget(current.left, target, path)){
            path.push('l');
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}

別人想出來更簡潔的遞迴
直接丟自己就好了

```

一樣的想法
```javascript
public final TreeNode getTargetCopy(final TreeNode original, final TreeNode cloned, final TreeNode target) {
		if (original == null || original == target)
			return cloned;
		TreeNode res = getTargetCopy(original.left, cloned.left, target);
		if (res != null)
			return res;
		return getTargetCopy(original.right, cloned.right, target);
	}
