# 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Tree` `DFS`

## 英文題目本身
Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.

Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an **uncolored** neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)

If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true.  If it is not possible, return false.

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The second player can choose the node with value 2.
```

Constraints:
```
root is the root of a binary tree with n nodes and distinct node values from 1 to n.
n is odd.
1 <= x <= n <= 100
```
## 題目要求

給你一棵樹, 給你這棵樹的總 node 數, 跟一個對方最先塗(紅色)的 node 值, 如果你找的到一個 node可以塗色塗得比紅色總數多的 node, 回傳 true

## 想法
The first player colors a node,
there are at most 3 nodes connected to this node.
Its left, its right and its parent.
Take this 3 nodes as the root of 3 subtrees.

The second player just color any one root,
and the whole subtree will be his.
And this is also all he can take,
since he cannot cross the node of the first player.

```javascript
class Solution {
    
    private int countOpenNodes(TreeNode n, int selected) {
        if(n == null || n.val == selected) { return 0; }
        
        return 1 + countOpenNodes(n.left, selected) + countOpenNodes(n.right, selected);
    }
    
    private TreeNode findNode(TreeNode n, int val) {
        if(n == null || n.val == val) { return n; }
                
        TreeNode found = findNode(n.left, val);
        if(found != null) { return found; }
        
        return findNode(n.right, val); 
    }
    
    public boolean btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode root, int n, int x) {
        
        TreeNode selected = findNode(root, x);
        
        int leftCnt = countOpenNodes(selected.left, x);
        int rightCnt = countOpenNodes(selected.right, x);
        int parentCnt = n - (1 + leftCnt + rightCnt);
        
        if(parentCnt > 1 + leftCnt + rightCnt) { return true; }
        if(rightCnt > 1 + parentCnt + leftCnt) { return true; }
        if(leftCnt > 1 + parentCnt + rightCnt) { return true; }
        
        return false;
    }
}
