# 1882. Process Tasks Using Servers
###### tags: `LeetCode` `medium+` `Heap`

## 英文題目本身
You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays servers and tasks of lengths n and m respectively. `servers[i]` is the weight of the ith server, and `tasks[j]` is the time needed to process the jth task in **seconds**.

Tasks are assigned to the servers using a task queue. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is empty.

At second j, the jth task is inserted into the queue (starting with the 0th task being inserted at second 0). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the smallest weight, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the smallest index.

If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned in order of insertion following the weight and index priorities above.

A server that is assigned task j at second t will be free again at second `t + tasks[j]`.

Build an array ans of length m, where `ans[j]` is the index of the server the `jth` task will be assigned to.

Return the array `ans`

Example 1:
```
Input: servers = [3,3,2], tasks = [1,2,3,2,1,2]
Output: [2,2,0,2,1,2]
Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows:
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.
- At second 1, server 2 becomes free. Task 1 is added and processed using server 2 until second 3.
- At second 2, task 2 is added and processed using server 0 until second 5.
- At second 3, server 2 becomes free. Task 3 is added and processed using server 2 until second 5.
- At second 4, task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 5.
- At second 5, all servers become free. Task 5 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: servers = [5,1,4,3,2], tasks = [2,1,2,4,5,2,1]
Output: [1,4,1,4,1,3,2]
Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows: 
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 1 until second 2.
- At second 1, task 1 is added and processed using server 4 until second 2.
- At second 2, servers 1 and 4 become free. Task 2 is added and processed using server 1 until second 4. 
- At second 3, task 3 is added and processed using server 4 until second 7.
- At second 4, server 1 becomes free. Task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 9. 
- At second 5, task 5 is added and processed using server 3 until second 7.
- At second 6, task 6 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.
 ```

Constraints:

- `servers.length == n`
- `tasks.length == m`
- `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5`
- `1 <= servers[i], tasks[j] <= 2 * 10^5`
## 題目要求
給妳server array 跟 task array, task上對應位置的值是消耗時間
回傳ans array, array裡面的值是對應 task是進到哪個 server上跑
## 想法
一開始題目看錯, 以為沒server後, 累積的task在有server出現後是要一秒一個進入server
