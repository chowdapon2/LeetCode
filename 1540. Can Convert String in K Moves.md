# 1540. Can Convert String in K Moves
###### tags: `LeetCode` `medium`

## 英文題目本身
Given two strings `s` and `t`, your goal is to convert `s` into `t` in `k` moves or less.

During the `i`th (1 <= `i` <= `k`) move you can:

- Choose any index `j` (1-indexed) from `s`, such that 1 <= `j` <= `s`.length and `j` has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index `i` times.
- Do nothing.

Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). Shifting a character by `i` means applying the shift operations `i` times.

Remember that any index `j` can be picked at most once.

Return true if it's possible to convert s into t in no more than k moves, otherwise return false.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "input", t = "ouput", k = 9
Output: true
Explanation: In the 6th move, we shift 'i' 6 times to get 'o'. And in the 7th move we shift 'n' to get 'u'.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "bcd", k = 10
Output: false
Explanation: We need to shift each character in s one time to convert it into t. We can shift 'a' to 'b' during the 1st move. However, there is no way to shift the other characters in the remaining moves to obtain t from s.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "aab", t = "bbb", k = 27
Output: true
Explanation: In the 1st move, we shift the first 'a' 1 time to get 'b'. In the 27th move, we shift the second 'a' 27 times to get 'b'.
  ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= k <= 10^9
- s, t contain only lowercase English letters.
## 題目要求
把字串s 在k步裡面轉成字串 t, 需要follow下面規則
在1~k的步驟中, 在第i步選到的字串, 可以shift i次, 每個字串只能修改一次
## 想法
沒想出來


#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
    public boolean canConvertString(String s, String t, int k) {
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        int[] count = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            // find difference it might be negative
            // so add 26 then %26 to make it postive
            int diff = (t.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i) + 26) % 26;
            /*
            If same displacement appears multiple times, the 
            1st time use the displacement itself
            the 2nd time add 26 to it
            the 3rd time add 26 * (3 - 1) = 52
            the 4th time add 26 * (4 - 3) = 78, etc.;
            if after adding the result is greater than k
            return false;
            */
            if (diff > 0 && diff + count[diff] * 26 > k) {
                return false;
            }
            ++count[diff];
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
