# 1927. Sum Game
###### tags: `LeetCode` `medium+` `Math` `Greedy`

## 英文題目本身
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with **Alice starting first**.

You are given a string num of **even length** consisting of digits and **'?'** characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one '?' in num:

Choose an index `i` where `num[i] == '?'`.
Replace `num[i]` with any digit between `'0'` and `'9'`.
The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num.

For Bob to **wi**n, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must **be equal to** the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must **not be equal**.

For example, if the game ended with num = "243801", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = "243803", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.
Assuming Alice and Bob play **optimally**, return `true` if **Alice** will w**in and `false` if **Bob** will win.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: num = "5023"
Output: false
Explanation: There are no moves to be made.
The sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half: 5 + 0 = 2 + 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: num = "25??"
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can replace one of the '?'s with '9' and it will be impossible for Bob to make the sums equal.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: num = "?3295???"
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible outcome is:
- Alice replaces the first '?' with '9'. num = "93295???".
- Bob replaces one of the '?' in the right half with '9'. num = "932959??".
- Alice replaces one of the '?' in the right half with '2'. num = "9329592?".
- Bob replaces the last '?' in the right half with '7'. num = "93295927".
Bob wins because 9 + 3 + 2 + 9 = 5 + 9 + 2 + 7.
``` 

Constraints:

- `2 <= num.length <= 10^5`
- `num.length` is **even**.
- num consists of only digits and '?'.**
## 題目要求
給你一個String, 裡面由0~9以及?組成
?的位置可以由Alice/Bob去填數字
- 如果整串填完的數字 左邊==右邊 =>Bob 贏, 回傳 false
- 如果整串填完的數字 左邊!=右邊 =>Alice 贏, 回傳 True
## 想法
想了一半,把左邊右邊分開算?個數後  如果左右邊?個數相同 且左右邊diff==0
那Bob一定贏
事後證明我的解法是錯誤的

大神的想法
First we scan the whole string, and find the

1. Difference between `left` part and `right` part, `diff = leftSum - rightSum`
2. The number of '?' of left part and right part, as left and right

It will come to the following situation:

1. If there is no '?', trivial answer.
2. If the number of the '?' left is odd, Alice will 100% win as Alice will take the last step.
3. If (left == right), it will be slightly tricky as whatever Alice placed a number in the question mark, Bob can always place the same number in the opporsite half to cancel the effect.
- So if (diff == 0), Alice will definately lose
- But if (diff != 0), say, diff > 0, Alice can place 9 on one of the left '?' and no matter what Bob do, Alice will win. Vise versa.
if (diff != 0), Alice will definately win.
- This is actually the same situation as (1) if there is no '?'
4. If `(left != right)` and `(left + right)` is even, say, left > right, we can deduce that:
- we can simply consider the situation that there is actually (left - right) '?' on the left and 0 '?' on the right. Because If Alice does not fill left first, and no matter how she tries to expand the abs(diff), Bob can always place a number on the opposite side.
So the question became: you will have to fill (left - right) gaps, to fulfill the difference diff.
There will be round = (left - right) /2 rounds. Remember (left - right) will always be even.

a. If the diff >= 0, while round > 0, Alice will win because there is no way for Bob to insert a negative number. Same case if diff <= 0.

b. Now diff * round < 0 case. The only situation Alice will lose, is the abs(diff) == abs(round * 9). It is because whatever number Alice chose, Bob can always find a number to make the sum to 9.

Final solution with comment:

```javascript
class Solution {
    public boolean sumGame(String num) {
       int diff = 0;
       int left = 0;
       int right = 0;
       for (int i = 0; i < num.length()/2; i++) {
           if (num.charAt(i) == '?') {
               left++;
           } else {
               diff += num.charAt(i) - '0';
           }
       }

       for (int i = num.length() / 2; i < num.length(); i++) {
           if (num.charAt(i) == '?') {
               right++;
           } else {
               diff -= num.charAt(i) - '0';
           }
       }
       // Situation 2
       if ((right + left) % 2 == 1) return true;
       // Situation 1 and 3
       if (left == right) {
           return diff != 0;
       }
       int round = (left - right) / 2;
       // Situation a
       if (diff * round >= 0) return true;
       return Math.abs(diff) != Math.abs(round * 9);
   }
}

Lee大神解
### Observation I
If Bob wants to win,
the number of '?' in input have to be even.
Otherwise, the game is finished by Alice,
Alice can win easily win.


### Observation II
If we add the same sum of digits to left and right,
this operation won't change the result.

If we add the same numnber of '?' with to left and right,
this operation won't change the result.


### Observation III
If Bow wants to win,
left sum and right sum need to be balance.
That is, left sum = right
But the value for '?' character?
'?' equals to its "expectation",
which is (0 + 9) / 2 = 4.5


### Explanation I
Example 1:
"??" = x
Bob can win if and only if x = 9.
x > 9, Alice makes "0?"
x < 9, Alice makes "9?"

### Example 2:
"????" = y
Bob can win if and only if y = 9 * 2 = 18.
y > 18, Alice makes "0???",
and it becomes the case x > 9 in example 1
y < 18, Alice makes "9???",
and it becomes the case x < 9 in example 1.

Example n:
"??...?" = z with n * 2 of '?'
Bob can win if and only if z = 9 * n.

This leads to conclusion that:
left sum + left '? ' / 2 * 9 == right sum + right '? ' / 2 * 9
which is the same as the observation III.

### Explanation II
Actually, we can take 4.5 as the default value of '?'.
If Bob wants to win, the initial sum should be balance.
The during the game,
When Alice fill one '?',
making it larger or smaller 4.5,
Bob can fill the other '?',
making it smaller and larger in the range.

And the condition is necessary and suffisant.

```java
    public boolean sumGame(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        double res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            res += (i < n / 2 ? 1 : -1) * (s.charAt(i) == '?' ? 4.5 : s.charAt(i) - '0');
        return res != 0;
    }
```
