# 1494. Parallel Courses II
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Hard` `Heap` `Kahn’s algorithm` `Topological Sort`

## 英文題目本身
Given the integer n representing the number of courses at some university labeled from 1 to n, and the array dependencies where dependencies[i] = [xi, yi]  represents a prerequisite relationship, that is, the course xi must be taken before the course yi.  Also, you are given the integer k.

In one semester you can take at most k courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites for the courses you are taking.

Return the minimum number of semesters to take all courses. It is guaranteed that you can take all courses in some way.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 4, dependencies = [[2,1],[3,1],[1,4]], k = 2
Output: 3 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph. In this case we can take courses 2 and 3 in the first semester, then take course 1 in the second semester and finally take course 4 in the third semester.
```
Example 2:
![](https://i.imgur.com/36RrXyo.png)
```
Input: n = 5, dependencies = [[2,1],[3,1],[4,1],[1,5]], k = 2
Output: 4 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph. In this case one optimal way to take all courses is: take courses 2 and 3 in the first semester and take course 4 in the second semester, then take course 1 in the third semester and finally take course 5 in the fourth semester.
```
Example 3:

```
Input: n = 11, dependencies = [], k = 2
Output: 6
 

```
Constraints:

```
1 <= n <= 15
1 <= k <= n
0 <= dependencies.length <= n * (n-1) / 2
dependencies[i].length == 2
1 <= xi, yi <= n
xi != yi
All prerequisite relationships are distinct, that is, dependencies[i] != dependencies[j].
The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
```

原本想參照 1462. Course Schedule IV 的 Topological Sort 實作, 結果失敗
下面是討論區大神解
#### 結果
```javascript
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOfSemesters(int n, int[][] dependencies, int k) {
        List<Integer>[] adj = new ArrayList[n];
        int[] outdegree = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        int[] indegree = new int[n];
        for(int[] e: dependencies){
            adj[e[0] - 1].add(e[1] - 1);
            outdegree[e[0] - 1]++;
            indegree[e[1] - 1]++;
        }
        
        // higher outdegree courses should be taken first
        PriorityQueue<Integer> q = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> outdegree[b] - outdegree[a]);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(indegree[i] == 0){
                q.add(i);
            }
        }
        // 只有 in degree 為0的才會被加入 q
        int ans = 0;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            // pick courses for current semester
            Queue<Integer> temp = new LinkedList<>();
            for(int i = Math.min(q.size(), k); i > 0; i--){
                temp.add(q.poll());
            }
            
            // remove dependencies 
            while(!temp.isEmpty()){
                int u = temp.poll();
                for(int v: adj[u]){
                    if(--indegree[v] == 0){
                        q.add(v);
                    }
                }
            }
            ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
