# 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Medium` `BFS`

## 英文題目本身
You are given an m x n matrix maze (**0-indexed**) with empty cells (represented as '.') and walls (represented as '+'). You are also given the entrance of the maze, where entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol] denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell **up, down, left, or right**. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the **nearest exit** from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the **border of** the maze. The entrance **does not count** as an exit.

Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or **-1** if no such path exists.

 

Example 1:
![](https://i.imgur.com/1k8ajNv.png)
```
Input: maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.
```
Example 2:
![](https://i.imgur.com/hpGr4mg.png)
```
Input: maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.
```
Example 3:
![](https://i.imgur.com/e5Od3d4.png)
```
Input: maze = [[".","+"]], entrance = [0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no exits in this maze.
```

Constraints:

- `maze.length == m`
- `maze[i].length == n`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `maze[i][j] is either '.' or '+'.`
- `entrance.length == 2`
- `0 <= entrancerow < m`
- `0 <= entrancecol < n`
- entrance will always be an empty cell.
## 題目要求
給你一個2D矩陣, 找最短出口的step數, 起始點如果在邊界不算出口
## 想法
BFS  但是會失敗, 失敗的點在我沒有把BFS最常用的"把queue的數量拿下來跑"

```javascript
class Solution {
    public int nearestExit(char[][] maze, int[] entrance) {
        int m = maze.length;
        int n = maze[0].length;
        // up, down, left, right
        int[][] directions = new int[][]{{-1,0},{1,0},{0,-1},{0,1}};
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
        visited[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = true;
        
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(new int[]{entrance[0],entrance[1]});
        int res = 0;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int[] cur = q.poll();
            int x = cur[0], y = cur[1];
            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir[0], ny = y + dir[1];
                if (nx < 0 || nx >= m || ny < 0 || ny >= n || visited[nx][ny] || maze[nx][ny]=='+') continue;
                res++;
                if(nx == m-1 ||nx ==0|| ny == n-1 ||ny ==0){
                    return res;
                }
                
                visited[nx][ny] =true;
                q.add(new int[]{nx,ny});
            }
        }
        return -1;
